**Joomla Website**

**Learning Activities & Resources**

During the process of constructing my Joomla website, I delved into a comprehensive YouTube tutorial for invaluable insights and a step-by-step guide (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5VZwTLdgdM&list=PLQSbA0rrCrqHZxODzTYgAaCp_zYI3Aiug&index=3). 

Additionally, I explored an entire playlist (https://www.youtube.com/@techruzz/playlists) to broaden my knowledge on website creation using Joomla.

To elevate the functionality and aesthetic appeal of my website, I integrated two essential Joomla extensions. 
The first, Smart Slider, can be accessed and downloaded at https://smartslider3.com/thank-downloading-smart-slider-3-free/. 
The second, Phoca Gallery, is available for download from https://www.phoca.cz/download/66-phoca-gallery/1-phoca-gallery-component.

It's worth noting that all the images featured on my website are ethically sourced from an open-source platform, specifically Google Images: https://www.google.com. This ensures compliance with open-source principles while adding a visually engaging touch to my Joomla website. If you have any further questions or need additional details about the website creation process, feel free to ask!

I use the platform cloud access to host the Joomla website: https://www.cloudaccess.net

**Estimated hours**

For this website, it takes around 28 to 32 hours to complete. This includes the time spent on design and planning, the learning curve associated with new tools like Joomla, customization of templates and extensions, and the creation of engaging content. Integrating features such as Smart Slider and Phoca Gallery, along with thorough testing, debugging, and optimization for performance and SEO, all contribute to this timeframe. The individual complexity of the website, my proficiency, and unexpected challenges also play a role. Allocating extra time for testing and addressing potential issues is crucial to ensure the final website is polished and fully functional.
